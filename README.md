# M4thThings
A random assortment of blocks to make your adventures more mathematical!

This mod really started as a chance for me to get back into programming after a long time away; I find it easier to code when you have a "tangible" end goal. With that being said, this mod is meant to be a sort of "utility" mod that doesn't have a theme of its own, but rather is meant to be used alongside other mods to enhance the playability. In the future, I may start adding more original content (I do have a few ideas), but that's probably a long way out.

I'm also open to suggestions, ideas, and constructive criticism from the community. You can contact me via YouTube, Twitter, or Twitch; all three have the same username: M4thG33k (or M4th G33k)!
